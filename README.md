MEDICARE PART D 2023 PROGRAM: Prescriber Tier Segmentation and Cost Analysis

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzed Medicare Part D 2023 claims data aggregated by prescriber  npi to uncover high-cost outliers, high-cost prescribing patterns and assign a cost-tier system for cost management strategies.

BUSINESS QUESTIONS & OBJECTIVES
•	What proportion of prescribers are responsible for most of the total cost per claim spending?
•	What prescriber cost segment is responsible for most of the Medicare Part D claims spending?
•	What prescriber specialty in the top 5% of prescribers by cost-per-claim impacts Medicare Part D claims spending the most?
•	What is the brand/generic prescribing rate of specialties in the top 5% of the cost per claim metric?

TOOLS & SKILLS USED
SQL – database set up, data cleaning, table creation, segmentation, KPI queries
Power BI – Power Query, dashboard, design, DAX Measures
Skills -data modelling, visualization

KEY INSIGHTS
•	Top 5% of prescribers by cpc contributed 50% of the total cpc 
•	Tier 3 & 4 prescribers 6.28% contributed 53.7% of the total cpc
•	Allergy/immunology specialty with the highest cpc value ($356,000) of the top 5% of prescribers recorded a brand drug prescribing rate of 93.91%
•	An unnamed specialty with the highest average cpc value ($50,000) of the top 5% of prescribers recorded a 100% brand drug prescribing rate
•	Hematology oncology with the highest total cpc value ($21.5M) of the top 5% of prescribers recorded an 83.23% brand drug prescribing rate





KEY RECOMMENDATION
Set up modalities to reduce the claims spending on Tiers 3 & 4 precribers by 50% and see a $70m savings on claims payment.

PRESCRIBED ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE THE KEY RECOMMENDATION
•	Audit Tier 3 & 4 prescribers: with unexplainably high cpc values to detect fraud, for educational purposes or formulary control
•	Offer formulary adherence support: to prescribers with low generic dispensing rate but high cost per claim or provide preferred alternatives to brand drugs
•	Shift Tiers 3 & 4 to Tiers 1 & 2: Focus on shifting the prescribing pattern of tier 3 and 4 prescribers to that of prescribers in the Tier 1 and 2 categories
